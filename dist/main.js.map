If set the `port`,\n * `host` and `family` will be ignored.\n * @param {number} [options.keepAlive=0] - TCP KeepAlive on the socket with a X ms delay before start.\n * Set to a non-number value to disable keepAlive.\n * @param {boolean} [options.noDelay=true] - Whether to disable the Nagle's Algorithm.

See https://github.com/luin/ioredis#tls-options\n * @param {string} [options.keyPrefix=''] - The prefix to prepend to all keys in a command.\n * @param {function} [options.retryStrategy] - See \"Quick Start\" section\n * @param {number} [options.maxRetriesPerRequest] - See \"Quick Start\" section\n * @param {number} [options.maxLoadingRetryTime=10000] - when redis server is not ready, we will wait for\n * `loading_eta_seconds` from `info` command or maxLoadingRetryTime (milliseconds), whichever is smaller.\n * @param {function} [options.reconnectOnError] - See \"Quick Start\" section\n * @param {boolean} [options.readOnly=false] - Enable READONLY mode for the connection.\n * Only available for cluster mode.\n * @param {boolean} [options.stringNumbers=false] - Force numbers to be always returned as JavaScript\n * strings. This option is necessary when dealing with big numbers (exceed the [-2^53, +2^53] range).\n * @param {boolean} [options.enableTLSForSentinelMode=false] - Whether to support the `tls` option\n * when connecting to Redis via sentinel mode.\n * @param {NatMap} [options.natMap=null] NAT map for sentinel connector.\n * @param {boolean} [options.updateSentinels=true] - Update the given `sentinels` list with new IP\n * addresses when communicating with existing sentinels.\n * @param {boolean} [options.failoverDetector=false] - Detect failover actively by subscribing to the\n * related channels. With this option disabled, ioredis is still able to detect failovers because Redis\n * Sentinel will disconnect all clients whenever a failover happens, so ioredis will reconnect to the new\n * master. This option is useful when you want to detect failover quicker, but it will create more TCP\n * connections to Redis servers in order to subscribe to related channels.\n* @param {boolean} [options.enableAutoPipelining=false] - When enabled, all commands issued during an event loop\n * iteration are automatically wrapped in a pipeline and sent to the server at the same time.\n * This can dramatically improve performance.\n * @param {string[]} [options.autoPipeliningIgnoredCommands=[]] - The list of commands which must not be automatically wrapped in pipelines.\n * @param {number} [options.maxScriptsCachingTime=60000] Default script definition caching time.\n  * @extends [EventEmitter](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_events_eventemitter)\n * @extends Commander\n * @example\n * ```js\n * var Redis = require('ioredis');\n *\n * var redis = new Redis();\n *\n * var redisOnPort6380 = new Redis(6380);\n * var anotherRedis = new Redis(6380, '192.168.100.1');\n * var unixSocketRedis = new Redis({ path: '/tmp/echo.sock' });\n * var unixSocketRedis2 = new Redis('/tmp/echo.sock');\n * var urlRedis = new Redis('redis://user:password@redis-service.com:6379/');\n * var urlRedis2 = new Redis('//localhost:6379');\n * var urlRedisTls = new Redis('rediss://user:password@redis-service.com:6379/');\n * var authedRedis = new Redis(6380, '192.168.100.1', { password: 'password' });\n * ```\n */\nexports.default = Redis;\nfunction Redis() {\n    if (!(this instanceof Redis)) {\n        console.error(new Error(\"Calling `Redis()` like a function is deprecated.
